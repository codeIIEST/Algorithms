# Backtracking Algorithms

What is Backtracking Algorithm ?
Recursion is the key in backtracking programming. As the name suggests we backtrack to find the solution. We start with one possible move out of many available moves and try to solve the problem, if we are able to solve the problem with the selected move then we will print the solution else we will backtrack and select some other move and try to solve it. If none if the moves work out we will claim that there is no solution for the problem.

Problem Description:
# # 1 N Queens Problem:
The N Queen is the problem of placing N chess queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other.

** [CODE](https://github.com/SKKSaikia/Algorithms/blob/br2/Competitive%20Coding/Backtrack/nQueen.cpp) **

# # 2 Sudoku:
Given a partially filled 9×9 2D array ‘grid[9][9]’, the goal is to assign digits (from 1 to 9) to the empty cells so that every row, column, and subgrid of size 3×3 contains exactly one instance of the digits from 1 to 9.

# # 3 15 Puzzle:
Find if arranging numbers in ascending order is possible row wise .Given, the initial configuration is scrambled up numbers in a board with one empty space.

# # 4 Hamiltonian Cycle:
Hamiltonian Path in an undirected graph is a path that visits each vertex exactly once. A Hamiltonian cycle is a Hamiltonian Path such that there is an edge from the last vertex to the first vertex of the Hamiltonian Path. Determine whether a given graph contains Hamiltonian Cycle or not. If it contains, then print the path.
