Given a cost matrix cost[ ][ ] and position (m, n) in cost[ ][ ].

Write a function that returns cost of minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0).

Each cell of the matrix represents a cost to traverse through that cell. 

Total cost of a path to reach (m, n) is sum of all the costs on that path (including both source and destination).

You can only traverse down, right and diagonally lower cells from a given cell, i.e., from a given cell (i, j), cells (i+1, j), (i, j+1) and (i+1, j+1) can be traversed.



1. Optimal Substructure
The path to reach (m, n) must be through one of the 3 cells: (m-1, n-1) or (m-1, n) or (m, n-1). So minimum cost to reach (m, n) can be written as “minimum of the 3 cells plus cost[m][n]”.

minCost(m, n) = min (minCost(m-1, n-1), minCost(m-1, n), minCost(m, n-1)) + cost[m][n]



2. Overlapping Subproblems
Like other typical Dynamic Programming(DP) problems, recomputations of same subproblems can be
avoided by constructing a temporary array tc[ ][ ] in bottom up manner.


Example:
3 3
1 2 3
4 8 2
1 5 3
