Given a set of non-negative integers, and a value sum, determine if there is a subset of the given set with sum equal to given sum.

Examples: set[ ] = {3, 34, 4, 12, 5, 2}, sum = 9

Output:  True  //There is a subset (4, 5) with sum 9.

Let isSubSetSum(int set[ ], int n, int sum) be the function to find whether there is a subset of set[] with sum equal to sum. n is the number of elements in set[ ].

The isSubsetSum problem can be divided into two subproblems:-

a) Include the last element, recur for n = n-1, sum = sum â€“ set[n-1]
b) Exclude the last element, recur for n = n-1.

If any of the above the above subproblems return true, then return true.

Following is the recursive formula for isSubsetSum() problem:-

isSubsetSum(set, n, sum) = isSubsetSum(set, n-1, sum) ||
                           isSubsetSum(set, n-1, sum-set[n-1])
Base Cases:
isSubsetSum(set, n, sum) = false, if sum > 0 and n == 0
isSubsetSum(set, n, sum) = true, if sum == 0

We can solve the problem in Pseudo-polynomial time using Dynamic programming. We create a boolean 2D table subset[ ][ ] and fill it in bottom up manner. The value of subset[i][j] will be true if there is a subset of set[0..j-1] with sum equal to i., otherwise false. Finally, we return subset[sum][n]
