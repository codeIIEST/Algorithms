/*Program to count the no of 1's  in the binary representation of a given decimal number using Bitwise Operations.
Algorithm::Let,x be the given decimal number. The binary representation of x and x-1 will have all bits equal except the righmost 1 in x and all digits after the 
rightmost digit are flipped. So if we perform x&(x-1) and store the result in x, the number of 1's in x gets reduced by 1.
So we can count how many times the operation can be performed and keep track of it using any counter variable.
Let. x=5
	Binary Representation of 5 is 101
	x=x&(x-1)=101 & 100 = 100
	x=x&(x-1)=100 & 011=000

So, the operation got performed for 2 times until x became 0. So, the number of 1's in x is 2.*/
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int x=4;
	int count=0;//Variable to store the number of 1's in the decimal representation of x

	while(x)
	{
		x=x&(x-1);
		count++;
	}

	cout<<"The number of 1's in the decimal representation of "<<x<<"is "<<count;
}
