# Contribution guidelines

First of all, thanks for thinking of contributing to this project. :smile:

Before sending a Pull Request, please make sure that you're assigned the task on a GitHub issue.

- If a relevant issue already exists, discuss on the issue and get it assigned to yourself on GitHub.
- If no relevant issue exists, open a new issue and get it assigned to yourself on GitHub.

Please proceed with a Pull Request only after you're assigned. It'd be sad if your Pull Request (and your hardwork) isn't accepted just because it isn't ideologically compatible.

While making a Pull Request, please take care of the following rules: 

- Make sure the master branch of your forked repo is not any commits ahead than the original master repository.
- Create a new branch from master in the forked repository. Updated your changes in that branch and not in master.
- Include only one algorithm in each pull request. A PR containing more than one algorithm *will not be merged*.
- Write your algorithm in a language other coders are mostly acquainted with i.e. `C`/`C++`/`Python`/`Java`. Any 
other language will be accepted only after discussion with the maintainers.
- When writing the algorithm's code, please include a small `readme.md` file in the folder briefly explaining the 
algorithm. Make sure your `readme.md` provides a clear understanding of the algorithm to a new-comer. Explanation 
should be given in not more than 300 characters
- Write the name of the algorithm you added and the language you used in the title while making the PR.
