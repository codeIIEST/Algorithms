# Heap sort is a comparison based sorting technique based on Binary Heap data structure.
# Heapsort is an in-place algorithm, but it is not a stable sort.
# Heap Sort is one of the best sorting methods being in-place and with no quadratic worst-case scenarios.
# In max-heaps, maximum element will always be at the root. Heap Sort uses this property of heap to sort the array.

Heap sort algorithm is divided into two basic parts :
(1) Creating a Heap of the unsorted list.
(2) Then a sorted array is created by repeatedly removing the largest/smallest element from the heap, and inserting it into the array. 
{3) The heap is reconstructed after each removal.

Time Complexity: Time complexity of heapify is O(logn). 
Time complexity of BUILD-MAX-HEAP(A) is O(n) 
and we run max_heapify Nâˆ’1 times in heap_sort function,
therefore complexity of heap_sort function in each case (Best, worst and average) is O(nlogn)

Space Complexity: O(1)
