Heap sort is a comparison based sorting technique based on Binary Heap data structure.
Heapsort is an in-place algorithm, but it is not a stable sort.
In max-heaps, maximum element will always be at the root. Heap Sort uses this property of heap to sort the array.

Algorithm :

MAX-HEAPIFY(A,i)
1 l = LEFT(i)
2 r = RIGHT(i)
3 if l <=A.heap-size and A[l]>A[i]
4 largest = l
5 else largest = i
6 if r <= A.heap-size and A[r] > A[largest]
7 largest = r
8 if largest != i
9 exchange A[i] with A[largest]
10 MAX-HEAPIFY(A,largest)

BUILD-MAX-HEAP(A)
1 A.heap-size = A.length
2 for i = floor(A.length/2) downto 1
3 MAX-HEAPIFY(A,i)

HEAPSORT(A)
1 BUILD-MAX-HEAP-(A)
2 for i = A.length downto 2
3 exchange A(1) with A(i)
4 A.heap-size = A.heap-size-1
5 MAX-HEAPIFY (A,1)


Time Complexity: Time complexity of heapify is O(Logn). 
Time complexity of BUILD-MAX-HEAP(A) is O(n) and overall time complexity of Heap Sort is O(nLogn).
